# MDWFM
fusing Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 simultaneously for accurate and stable river water extent mapping

This repositry is the codes for extracting river water information using Multi-dimensional Weighted Fusion Method (MDWFM). This method was implemented in Python.

The corresponding paper is currently under review by IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing. Please cite as below if you are using these codes.
